        I like doing fun stuff. That's why I work on Magnon stuff most
        of the time! I also like learning Japanese and occasionally even
        playing games. I don't really play games that often becasue I,
        uhm... You know... I make them more than I play them. I also
        really enjoy web development. Anyway, see you around!

        What I do when it comes to Magnon is programming, but what I
        really love is designing and creating a game that is actually
        fun to play. I am a PC gamer, mostly because my finger
        coordination is just horrible. One important thing to note
        is that I am horrible at spelling.

        I like graphics, sculpting and animation. Therefore, I’m the
        one responsible for that part. When not doing graphics
        related stuff I like to play games or just sleep. I’m not a
        big fan of social media so Steam is the place.
