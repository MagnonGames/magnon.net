    probably knew that, but what you may not have known is that this website
    is actually open source in its entirety. That's right, you can go and have
    a look at all the code that runs this website. Feel free to also help out
    by submitting pathces and improvements. If you need help with getting

<magnon-card id="dtile">
    <h2 slot="title">DTile</h2>
    DTile is a new take on the very old concept of a tilemap editor. It's made
    to have a modern look and feel while being very portable. That goal is
    realised by having DTile run on modern browser technology.
    <br><br>
    It's still very heavily in development (and has been for a while) so don't
    expect to be able to use it for a while.

    <h2 slot="title">[Inactive] Pillow Knights</h2>
    Pillow Knights is Magnon's first real game. Your goal is to fight off all
    the cats trying to invade the world so you can reach the core of all their
    evil. It's made and distributed for web and mobile and although it started
    off as a Unity game for desktop, we soon realised that wouldn't cut it, so
    it's now made with a custom JavaScript WebGL engine.

    <b>Update (11/6-2017)</b>: Pillow Knights for web is no longer available.
